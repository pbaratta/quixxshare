quixx is a game that is pretty easy to play remotely. players take turns,
 rolling the dice and marking out squares on their scoresheet.

to play remotely, the least we need to do is have the active player push the
 "roll" button and everyone's screens update with the current roll.

to make it more complicated, we can model the scoresheets and highlight
 available moves to the player. this would allow AI play as well.


-----<{[ EASY VERSION ]}>-----

1. identify yourself
2. click "roll" -> server responds with a roll
	"Pete rolled a 3/4/5/4/2/1"
3. roll history available


-----<{[ COMPLICATED VERSION ]}>-----

assemble the group:
1. player1 asks to start a game, gets a room code
2. player2 .. playerN join via code
3. player1 chooses to start game



play the game:

server
player1
player2
player3
...


1. server says "player1 it's your turn"
2. player1 rolls
3. everyone sees the roll
4. player1 picks their move
5. all other players get to pick theirs if they'd like
6. player1 turn is over

4/5 may be switched, can't remember the rules.
4/5 may lead to a row being finished:
	1. prompt a last chance for people to pick the row
	2. forbid people from picking it after
	3. scores for the row solidified (enter on scoresheet)
	4. the second row finished ends the game
